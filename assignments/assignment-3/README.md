## Assignment Summary

In the prior assignment we implemented and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) called LeNet-5 to classify the MNIST Handwritten Digit dataset. MNIST is considered to be the "Hello, world!" dataset when training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Now that we have successfully trained a network to reasonably high accuracy, we need to learn how to otpimize and implement DNNs that can perform less "trivial" tasks.

In this assignment, you will develop, train, and optimize a DNN to classify the ??? dataset and compete with your fellow classmates.

## 0. Preliminaries:

1. Ensure that you have filled out the class Kaggle Sign Up form [here]().

2. Be comfortable with running and modifying Jupyter Notebooks on Kaggle.

3. Ensure you understand the LeNet-5 network defined in the prior assigment.


## 1. Opening the Competition and Run the Baseline Model

## 2. Develop your own network

## 3. Benchmark your network

## 4. Submit your network to the competition

## 5. Repeat
